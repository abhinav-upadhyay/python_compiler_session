# Python Compiler Session

Code from the live session I did for my Substack paid subscribers on 14th December 
on implementing a bytecode compiler and VM for a tiny subset of Python in Python.

We could only get to adding support for these features in 3 hours:

- Handling constants
- Handling assignments
- Handling binary ops

But it gave an overview of the general design of a bytecode compiler and VM, and how they work underneath.
